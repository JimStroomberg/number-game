# Project Overview

## What It Does:
The program randomly selects a number (say, between 1 and 100) and prompts the user to guess it. After each guess, the program gives feedback—telling the user if their guess is too low, too high, or correct.

## What You’ll Learn:
__Basic Control Structures:__ Loops and conditional statements to handle game logic.\
__User Input:__ Capturing and validating input from the terminal.\
__Random Number Generation:__ Using Python’s random module.\
__Exception Handling:__ Managing errors when the user enters invalid data.

## Key Points in the Code:
__Random Number:__ The number is generated using random.randint(1, 100).\
__User Input and Validation:__ The program uses input() to get user input and try/except to catch non-integer inputs.\
__Game Loop:__ A while True loop keeps the game running until the correct number is guessed.
